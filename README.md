**Todo's on the roadmap:**
- Fix clearing of frames
- Connect/Disconnect button action
- Fix spacings and layout
- "Always on" function's radio buttons / button
- Consider auto-refresh
- maybe graphs where relevant eg. latency
- Can it show connect status on panel when minimized?

**Versions:**
V0.1 - Initial release on 29 Dec 2021. Basically functional but needs connect button to be activated.
